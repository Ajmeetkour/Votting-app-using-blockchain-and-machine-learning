# 🗳️ Blockchain & Machine Learning-Enhanced Voting App

This project presents a secure and intelligent voting system that leverages the **immutability of Blockchain** and the **predictive power of Machine Learning (ML)** to enhance electoral integrity. It integrates advanced ensemble models for fraud detection and a decentralized blockchain network to ensure transparency and tamper-resistance in the voting process.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🔐 **Blockchain Integration** for vote immutability and transparency
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Ensemble Model** combining Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression with 97% accuracy
- 📊 Real-time anomaly detection and fraud prevention
- 🌐 Scalable and secure architecture for public or private elections

## 🧪 Methodology Overview

- **ML Training:** Simulated voting data used to train ensemble models (Random Forest + KNN)
- **Smart Contracts:** Developed for voter registration, vote casting, and result tallying on Ethereum
- **System Design:** Includes user authentication, decentralized storage, and fraud detection engine
- **Validation:** Performance tested with precision, recall, F1 score, and error metrics

## 📈 Results

- Achieved **high precision and recall**, ensuring minimal false positives/negatives
- **F1 Score** demonstrated robust prediction capability
- Lowest error rate achieved using the hybrid model

## 🔮 Future Scope

- National-scale deployment
- Improved accessibility for tech-challenged or disabled users
- Integration with existing electoral infrastructure
- Establishment of global blockchain voting standards
